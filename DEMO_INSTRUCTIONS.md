## Script Template

```
[INTRO]
"Welcome to the Universal FHEVM SDK - a framework-agnostic solution for building
privacy-preserving applications with Zama's FHE technology."

[INSTALLATION]
"Getting started is incredibly simple. Just run npm install @fhevm/universal-sdk,
and you're ready to go. Here's how easy it is to encrypt data and interact with
FHE contracts - less than 10 lines of code."

[DEMO - PASSENGER]
"Let me show you a real-world example - a private rideshare platform. As a passenger,
I can connect my wallet and request a ride. Notice the transaction is confirmed on
Sepolia, but the sensitive data is encrypted using FHE."

[DEMO - DRIVER]
"Now let's switch to the driver view. I can register as a driver, toggle my
availability, and accept ride requests. All the sensitive location and fare data
remains private on-chain."

[PRIVACY]
"The key innovation here is that encryption happens entirely client-side. Private
keys never leave your browser, and the FHEVM gateway handles decryption with proper
authorization."

[MULTI-FRAMEWORK]
"What makes this SDK unique is its framework-agnostic design. The same core works
with React, Next.js, Vue, or even Node.js backends. We provide familiar hooks and
patterns that web3 developers already know."

[CONTRACT]
"Here's our deployed contract on Sepolia Etherscan. It's fully verified and you can
see all the FHE operations happening on-chain with complete privacy."

[CLOSING]
"The Universal FHEVM SDK checks all the boxes: easy to use, complete FHEVM integration,
reusable across frameworks, well-documented, and demonstrated with a production-ready
example. Check out our GitHub repository and start building privacy-preserving apps
today!"
```

## Video Editing

### Basic Edits
- Trim unnecessary pauses
- Speed up slow sections (1.5x)
- Add smooth transitions between sections
- Include title cards for each section

### Optional Enhancements
- Background music (low volume, royalty-free)
- Highlight cursor movements
- Zoom in on important code
- Add text annotations
- Picture-in-picture for narration

### Compression

If file size > 100MB, use HandBrake:
1. Open demo.mp4 in HandBrake
2. Select preset: "Fast 1080p30"
3. Set quality: RF 23-25
4. Format: MP4
5. Encode and save

## Upload Instructions

Once recorded:
1. Save as `demo.mp4`
2. Place in root of `fhevm-react-template/` directory
3. Verify file size < 100MB
4. Test playback on different devices
5. Include in competition submission

## Alternative: YouTube Link

If the video is too large for direct upload:
1. Upload to YouTube (unlisted or public)
2. Create a file called `DEMO_VIDEO_LINK.txt`
3. Add the YouTube URL to the file
4. Include both in submission
